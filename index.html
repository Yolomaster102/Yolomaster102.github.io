<h4>Hello M8's. Be Sure To Subscribe To Me On YouTube At Yolo Master102. Also Don't Forget To Drink Bleach,Smoke Cardboard, And Drill Yourself In The Head. Be Sure To Check Out My M8's Such As Acquinity,SF Cuber,Srod Plays, And WiRE Zen
But Anyways You Are Probably Here For The Amazing Mobile Game Links So You Can Play Them,Since I'm Too Lazy To Make A Video I Will Just Rant On This Website. <br /><br /> 4/14/16- Today 'Shun' AKA 'The Smart Kid' He Got Busted For Cheating In Math Jeopardy, The Story Goes Like This, We Were Playing Jeopardy In Math Class And Everyone Wanted Him On The Team. He Is Like A 'God' According To Retarded People.And The Whole Time He Was Cheating By Pulling Up The Same Website From Where The Teacher Got The PowerPoint And He Got Caught.<br /><br />4/15/16 So For Today's 'Juicy Story'/ Roast Is Going To Be On Someone Known As Ms.Baker, To Sart Things Of She Can't Pronouns Her O's So When She Says Probability For Example She Would Say Prububility. She Also Only Targets Aquinity, Like The Other Day Someone Said 'Drink Bleach' (It Wasn't Aquinity) And She Blamed It On Him. Another Example Of Her Hatred For Acquinity Is That One Day He Was Late For Class With His Buddy 'Tyrone Jackson' Literally 3 Seconds And She Wrote Them Up But Then 2 Girls Came In Late About 5 Minuets  And She Didn't Even Care BUT THATS NOT ALL Later That Day She Said She Was All About Fairness</h4>
